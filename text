I had a great weekend. My wife and I got married 30 years ago. My wife and I were really surprised when our son came to our house on Thursday evening. He then took us to the airport and gave us two tickets to go to Rome! He paid for everything: the flight, the hotel, everything. We had a lovely weekend. We remembered the night we got married. It was wonderful.
